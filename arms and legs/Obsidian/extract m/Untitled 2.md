I need to write an incident report if I give you all the details.  
I need you to write it out in a formatted formal way including the mentioned time stamps and formal so that I can send it to my housing officer Suzie WInters. My name is Lawrence Turner.  
I live at 10 Buriton house po1 1JJ. Suszie addresses 24 Commercial Pl, Portsmouth PO1 4DT.  
  
The incident was around at 11:00hrs  on the 16th of the 6th 2023 which is a Friday last approx. 40 mins, loud shouting and swearing between Charlotte and I did occur.  
(additional context) On coming home to my property after returning from a hospital appointment at st. marys Walk in Centre, I stopped at Johns (flat 2) reached over the fence and stroked John dog and wanted to see if he was in, i received a  payment today and thought to offer to just buy a broom (£5 limit) for him to settle his grievance and take back the one i provided him so he wasn't at a loss.  
I called out for John the tenant who previously in a misunderstanding, accused me or taking a broom of his this matter has been previously reported to As at that time i started a (rag & bone) business where I've been collecting used items as stock.    
I feel i've done my due diligence (Announcing/ contacting relevant parties About my activities And intentions).  
  
I've asked the community. I've run it by housing. I've run it by my counsellor verbally who lives two doors down. I'm very public and open with what I'm doing. And had positive feedback thus far.  
   
(more context) There was on  discrepancy recently due to my leg injury where I had collected a commercial fridge,  Unable to get it up my stairs at 12 a.m. On the 12th june 2023.  I had previously (with permission) stored items over night in the garden of Rose Marlow at flat 5, but this option was no longer available and the temperature was high 20’s, a heatwave.  
I had no choice late at night but to leave, rest and finish the move into my property the next day.  
The fridge in the Courtyard I did leave it there, out of the way of any doors.  
 I took photos and wrote a message to contact me if there are any problems. I left for Crawley at 4 a.m. To see my son. I returned at 2300 hrs that night to find a note from the council attached to my front door asking me to remove the ‘bulky item’ that has been mistakenly assumed i was fly tipping.  
 The letter gave less than 12 hours notice to remove or a charge would be added to my rent account. I satisfied that request after casually running it past the councillor Cal Corkey on whether I should contest it. These are anecdotal additions because they were highlighted in the onslaught that I just received from Charlotte at number 6.  
  
The account of events went EXACTLY like this., I walked into the Courtyard after visiting john (flat 2) garden,  
I have walked miles on this day, been up since 4am, I've just reinstated my ADHD medication from the pharmacy moments before, it was kicking in it is very hot somewhere between 25 and 28 degrees on this day.  
  
In the Courtyard is Charlotte's 6 garden. Charlottes dog, Branston comes out and often greets me,  this was the case on this day,  
I stroked him and I noticed Wayne from  flat 15. (The third floor)  was overlooking the whole event. On looking Into the Courtyard.  
  
Charlotte comes out and in a calm voice tells me that she's just flee-treated branston and I'll get it on my hands. I jokingly replied. “Oh well, it will get rid of my fleas as well.”  
   
No shorter than two seconds later. Charlotte announces by raising her tone that she's had a conversation with John at flat 2 earlier in the morning who is irritated by an apparent report about his rose bush.  
Implicating Charlotte (and or me!?!) doing so, frustrated her?    
I remarked it had nothing to do with me.  
This is what she was repeating to me in an aggressive tone.    
Observationally I suppose She needed to validate  this behaviour. Charlotte's presentation to me rose very quickly,  it became aggressive and Blunt and the content of the conversation Tangented to all of her immediate frustrations it seemed, which included, dog waste in the recycle bin, bed frames in the bin area, “Shit everywhere” “Dogs Barking’” and that i apparently have gone around saying someone has reported me opposed to the Council Utility workers making the bulk item report.  
Much of her arguments were Hearsay, stories, non-factly based rant, misconstrued and emotionally driven through what I believe to be from gossip, Chinese whispers and venting (Who said what to who, reported what to who etc).  I was then accused with this tone, that it was me that reported John for said rosebush, visual spit projectiled from charlottes mouth as her frustrations multiplied and my chance to respond fairly prevented.  
  
  
I highlighted that I have no interest in reporting anybody, not only do I suffer from reading and writing. Regarding learning difficulties, I've also about to venture into home business it wouldnt really be in my interest.I'm trying to see ends meet by selling items out of my balcony, to begin with, later services and hopefully a positive community aspect.  
Which I  aforementioned to the housing officer,  councillor and my neighbours..i want to make proactive effort in trying to create an environment where our community Burton House can come together similar to that of Darwin House across the street.  
Suggestions of a monthly fate with a drop-in clinic with the councillor and other activities are yet to be planned and discussed i told charlotte this.  
   
I've also within my capacity carried out diligence by getting to know the neighbours over the recent weeks and familiarising myself with them, letting them know what I'm up to and offering any services or help or items that they might like for free. From out of Goodwill all received positively (at least to me face)  until this point.    
  
Is that this moment I admit, My response could have been more controlled but instead given I've been up for 15 hours, and do not like being attacked in any way. Just come back from the hospital on the sore leg and at The onset of my ADHD medication I saw no reason for her outburst and no chance to reply. It was unreasonable unwarranted. if it were a male matching the above description and there wasn't a fence between us,  Anyone looking would have thought she was trying to attack me.  
An incessant rant followed: profanity and swear words were exchanged between the both of us, I took a stance given the flight and Flight of the situation. I negatively reacted to being falsely accused and further was not going to be shouted at in public by a non-authority without an opportunity to respond., This altercation lasted about 20 minutes.  
  
If stereotypes (perhaps traditional males vs female) were a lens,  Wayne commented that my response could have been way better and more handled given the circumstances.  
At the time I immediately rebutted that and felt justified in Quote “giving as good as i get”  
I'm tired of being attacked Without due course and proper litigation  and despite my heated response which matches that of Charlotte's not above,  i can see on reflection it made zero progress to a resolution..  
I will always look to remedy any problems i cause in the eyes of a person, but also see if I'm going to start a business I must have responsible  procedures in place to deal with such grievances,  as I would like to have a smooth operation  And not be impacted by irrelevant input to my business operation.  
  
 This means if a neighbour has a problem I've asked them to print or announce any problems; To knock or notify me by email or through the door. At their earliest convenience.    
  
Supplemental: Other comments were made in case this gets taken further I must include them in this document so I'm not formally at a disadvantage at a later stage.  
  
Charlotte was upset that John discussed something to do with his rose bush being reported.  
There had been an incident between John and I weeks ago (the mattr was also reported), whereby john felt i, laurence had stolen his broom which I remedied by giving him another broom.  
I went to offer today to go and buy him a new one he wants even though I repeat I have nothing to do with his broom.  
  
I just thought it was the best thing to do to sort everything, noting as well in my limited experience and assumption, people/ Neighbours that I'm interacting with seem  to share similar neuro-diverse characteristics to my myself, Communication emotions running high and misinterpretation or all factors here.  
  
This wasn't satisfactory for Charlotte and from Wayne's point of view a man arguing the same way as a woman is not etiquette and after the event, I agree. But I still behaved and carried on and conducted myself as aforementioned.    
  
Once the initial issue had been sorted. I had addressed her problem about my fridge being reported and the council utility services being the reporter not any of my neighbours. I also told her that I remedied that problem and removed it from the area.  
  
I added that I would speak to John to find out exactly what was said and see if there was any misinterpretation.  
I also offered to show the letter I received from the council to show that I had addressed it and that it was between me and the council, not my neighbours.  
  
Interesting anecdote: the exact broom that John describes as green with long garden bristles sits a similar almost exact description of abroom in Charlotte's garden, which I mentioned,  She went indoors slamming the door. Charlotte Returned moments later once I rolled a cigarette in the Courtyard, i was conversing with Wayne about my conduct in future scenarios.  
  
through the window, she made comments  “that cigarette taste funny?!?!”  as I probably have flea solution on it..  
Charlotte then came back into her garden and repeated this sentiment, which I found Antagonistic and noted this to her.  Frustrated on several fronts now I reminded her that I'm not a bad person. I do have learning difficulties and not bring giving any opportunity to explain. it's not a conversation. It's an attack.  
 I had no recording devices or mobile phones on me. to verify this statement.    
I did comment with both present Wayne and Charlotte about what is it I do wrong  
  
Wayne did note that last night (15th June). He felt that I was very loud  Moving things out of my flat just before 10 pm which I believe to be the cutoff.  
Although I do understand courtesy to neighbours isn't exactly black and white policy.  
Wayne Said that my activity is what is setting off the neighbour's dogs.  
Without trying to be rude in a calmer tone i said,  
“Although I understand and that perhaps the spaniel at number 4 is particularly Attached to me as I walk him often and perhaps he hears me.”  
  
The dog might be signalling  that I'm around by Barking,  I noted this and remarked ill be more considered in the future, but at the same time it isn't my responsibility to control a dog I do not own, in the confines of its own home.  
  
Out of total frustration, I remarked to Charlotte about events between us in our past hopefully to make sense out of her rage.  
From my understanding Charlotte feels unfairly accused by John  so emotions must have been running high understandably, but im firm. In NO  way her approach was acceptable, I responded in Kind which escalated the situation.  
  
Although I could have done better professionally. I don't see any reason Why i was subjected to that. There are official procedure in place if a conversation isn't an option, from medication to police presence. I  remarked that I've done lots for her in the past.  
In her vile mood, she was spitting literal saliva from her mouth And quote “what is it LOZ? What have you ever done, WHAT HAVE YOU EVER DONE FOR ME?!??”.    
  
To which I responded to notable events, namely  
I offered and took her dog in my car to the PDSA when it was dying and when she couldn't deal with that dog dying. I not long met charlotte. I was the one who held her dog in the PDSA while they gave it the lethal injection.  Sometime in 2020*  
Sometime in 2022 if it wasn't for my intervention of her ex-partner attacking her with an actual Hatchet axe and my partner at the time recording the event. I intervened and stopped Lee from attacking Charlotte he then threatened me with the axe, my footage secured his 2 year conviction. Police arrived With guns to arrest him.  
  
Now while I'm not looking for any recognition. But at the same time never expect to be subject without warning to essentially A verbal attack Riddled with various threats about what’s going to happen in the future because Charlotte was disgruntled over a rose bush?!?!?!  
It was to highlight that charlotte was not in the right mind at this current time and if charlotte feels like not saying sorry, be pejorative or feels like making my life more difficult and photograph and Report every one of my movements and activity moving forward, i said She's free to do so.  
I feel that I've done my diligence and if it comes out eventually via discussion with the housing office i must stop then i will.  
  
However right now. I believe I'm acting perfectly within my rights.  
I often don't take the time to write and I'm not entirely sure this is exactly compos mentis,  
However my prerogative to note an event and report it to at least a soft authority i believe is correct.  
I feel if I don't tell somebody, it may come back to bite me later.  
  
The situation is left that charlotte is frustrated to my knowledge, Charlotte was quote “Only telling me, laurence about flea treatment” and “The entire block use of the bins and knows Rose leaves bulky items” and “sick of everything mate”.  
  
I apologised to Wayne about the noise last night and would not do this in the future.  
 I've discussed with the bulky items collection team 'Cola's and 'Biffa',  And essentially in the early stages of this business for four weeks now. I've been collecting items that I think would have. Upcycle value, I'm not looking to make a profit. Just save things from landfill and generate interest in my business.  
The general rule of thumb I've employed is if I found it in a bin. On the estate. And I cannot make use of some or all or it,  I return it to my bin.  
If advised I can happily return it to where I found it as I don't see why this effort being slightly  Philanthropic should then start to incur me costs.  
I don't officially have a business yet. It isn't registered. I've not made a transaction. I have not put out advertising I have not received any money.  
I have documented, photographed and timestamped things to the best of my ability and communicate with those who I feel are relevant with what I'm doing here.  
Let this be the record. Any advice or further steps ready appreciated.
